# Collaborating Financial concepts to analyse the future of Hindustan Media Ventures Ltd.

Hindustan Media Ventures Ltd. is a publishing company that publishes the “Hindustan” Hindi newspaper, covering news across the entire spectrum of international, national,and local news related to business, politics, business, sports, and other general
interests.

The performance of the company has been mixed ever since the launch of the IPO due to the volatile nature of the media industry. The advertising revenue proves to be a major chunk of the entire revenue generated by the company which keeps on varying
due to the seasonal nature of political elections and events of public attention.

Hindustan Media Ventures Limited stock price has experienced a significant decline, and this can be attributed to several key factors identified in our analysis. Over the past year, the company's financial results have consistently reflected negative income, which has gradually decreased over time. These announcements have had a strong impact on the company's stock prices. Additionally, the company has experienced instability in its top management, with frequent changes in CEO positions.

Furthermore, the fact that the top three executives are from the same family has created an information asymmetry between the company and its top management. The company's poor performance can also be attributed to increased competition within the media industry and economic downturns, which have resulted in decreased
investor confidence and a sell-off of shares, ultimately leading to a decline in share prices. Our analysis also revealed that the company's performance has been particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with economic recession significantly affecting its operations.
